Word-in-Context (WiC) disambiguation is a classification task where the goal is to disambiguate polysemous words, without relying on a fixed resource of word senses. In particular in this homework we were asked to identify whether, given a sentence pair and a polysemous target lemma, the target lemma is used in both sentences with the same meaning or not.

Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) is a particular LP task where the goal is to predict the aspect terms regarding a given set of target entities, an the sentiment expressed towards each aspect. In this assignment we were also asked to classify the category of each aspect term and the overall sentiment polarity expressed towards the category.
