## I: Network Analysis on Liver Fibrosis

In this project we carry on a preliminary network medicine analysis on the pathology Liver Fibrosis. We start from existing knowledge about this pathological condition collecting the human genes interested, the seed genes. Then we collect the protein-protein interaction data on the seed genes and their interactomes, and finally we perform some enrichment analysis and the actual network analysis over the collected data.

## II: Brain network study during resting state

Second project of Bioinformatics & Network Medicine 20/21, Sapienza University of Rome. In this report we describe how we conducted the study of the a brain network during resting phase with eyes open and eyes closed. We used the EEG data of subject S003 from the dataset of PhysioNet [1] [2] (reachable here [3]) to perform functional connectivity analysis. The analysis is divided into four steps; connectivity estimation and network creation, network analysis through local and global indices, motif analysis and community detection. We used Python to conduct these tests.
