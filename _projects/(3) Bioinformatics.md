## I: Network Analysis on Liver Fibrosis

A preliminary network medicine analysis on the pathology Liver Fibrosis. We started from existing knowledge about this pathological condition collecting the human genes interested, the seed genes. Then we collected the protein-protein interaction data on the seed genes and their interactomes, and finally we performed some enrichment analysis and the actual network analysis over the collected data.

## II: Brain network study during resting state

Second project of Bioinformatics & Network Medicine. We have conducted a study of the a brain network during resting phase with eyes open and eyes closed. We used the EEG data of subject S003 from the dataset of PhysioNet (available [here](https://physionet.org/content/eegmmidb/1.0.0/)) to perform functional connectivity analysis. The analysis is comprised of four steps: connectivity estimation and network creation, network analysis through local and global indices, general motif analysis and community detection. We used Python to conduct these tests.
